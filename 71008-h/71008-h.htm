alt="O"></span>F all literary reputations, that of the Society Poet is probably
enjoyed upon the most hazardous and uncertain of tenures. To be
successful at all, he must win the instant recognition of his immediate
contemporaries; he must be in touch with the thought of his own
generation; he must reflect its sentiments, chime with its humour, and
satirise its manners; and in proportion to the popularity of his
productions with the public of his own day, will probably be the neglect
with which they are treated by the public of a generation later. This
neglect on the part of posterity is to some extent comprehensible, even
reasonable, for the poem of manners is often nothing more than purely
ephemeral in character, and indebted to accident for even its
contemporary success, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_8">{8}</a></span> measure of which is not to be relied upon as
a fair criterion of its intrinsic excellence. Still posterity is apt to
be careless and indiscriminating in its neglectfulness. True wit, true
humour, true grace and refinement are qualities that should command
something more than a fleeting popularity; but even where the public is
content, on the strength of the critical verdict of a past generation,
to admit that, beyond his fellows, So-and-So was graceful, humorous, and
witty, it is often content to let the matter rest there, and not trouble
itself with inquiring into the evidence upon which such verdict was
founded. Our own century can count not a few poets of barren reputation,
much admired, on the strength of old tradition, but very little read.
George Canning’s wit was, and is, proverbial. Most people have heard of
the “Anti-Jacobin Review,” and have some slight knowledge of the “Needy
Knife-grinder;” beyond that it would puzzle most people to supply any
specific information as to anything that he wrote that justifies his
reputation. Captain Charles Morris, of the First Life Guards and The
Beefsteak Club, wrote enough verse (and very delightful verse it is) to
fill a bulky volume, in addition to much more that for sufficient
reasons was not re-published in volume form. Part of one line of one
poem, “The sweet shady side of Pall Mall,” alone survives, apparently
for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_9">{9}</a></span> especial benefit of leader-writers in the daily papers.
Winthrop Mackworth Praed, most precocious and most prolific of the poets
of society, began his literary career as a schoolboy, and for twenty
years flooded the periodical literature of his day with songs and
satires, ballads and legends innumerable, all of which are forgotten. It
is not quite fair, perhaps, to say all, for some half-dozen pieces at
most survive, and have done duty with monotonous regularity, as
representative specimens of his verse, in every volume of poetical
selections of the <i>Vers de Société</i> order that has seen the light for
the last quarter of a century. Thus, Praed’s “Good Night to the Season”
has become a well-known poem; it is witty, full of brilliant antithesis
and word-play, a fairly typical example of Praed’s style; still it palls
by too frequent repetition, and Praed did much work that is quite equal
to it, and some that is even better, and better worth quoting. That
Praed’s contemporaries thought too highly of him is not, I think, open
to question; that he has, since his death, been unreasonably neglected
is, at least, equally true. Of his earlier work much is very weak.
Youthful poems, if noticeable for the precocity of their writers, are
not usually remarkable for their strength or originality. In his more
mature days he perpetrated a good deal of verse that is not much above
the standard<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_10">{10}</a></span> of the “Keepsake” and “Book of Beauty,” in the pages of
which polite publications one is quite content to let it rest
undisturbed; but beyond all this he wrote a great deal that deserves to
live, and that, so far, has hardly had a fair chance of life given to
it. In the first instance, Praed was himself responsible for the
smothering of his offspring. He seems to have been very indifferent
about the ultimate fate of his productions, or about the permanence of
his own literary reputation. Everything that he wrote was contributed to
periodicals; he never published a book of his own, nor apparently
contemplated the collection of any of his poems into a volume, with the
exception of some of his political squibs, which, in the last year of
his life, he had printed for private circulation among friends. When he
died, there was a scheme set on foot for collecting and publishing his
poems, and the editorial work was entrusted to his early friend, the
Rev. Derwent Coleridge. Four-and-twenty years after, Mrs. Praed being
then dead also, the editor completed his labours, and the book was at
length given to the world. Mr. Coleridge did his work only <i>too</i> well.
Every fragment of childish verse, all the boyish contributions to the
<i>Etonian</i>, every school exercise, every bit of inane, cut-and-dried
sentimentality that could be hunted up and identified<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_11">{11}</a></span> in the pages of
<i>Friendship’s Offerings</i>, and the like, were rigorously printed, and
poor Praed’s handfuls of corn were ruthlessly smothered under his
bushels of chaff. One merit was claimed for the book&#8212;that of being
complete. That merit, unfortunately, did not belong to it, as, for some
unexplained reason, the political poems, which are numerous and witty,
were altogether excluded. This book, in two volumes, was published in
1864. In 1866 Sir George Young, Praed’s nephew, edited a small volume of
selections, which was compiled with taste and judgment, as far as it
went; but the book was as meagre and insufficient as its predecessor had
been bulky and redundant. Both these books have long been out of print
and unattainable, and in offering what claims to be a fairly
representative selection of the best work of the poet, of whom the most
finished literary artist of our day, Mr. Frederick Locker, remarks, that
“in his peculiar vein he has never been equalled, and, it may safely be
affirmed, can never be excelled,” it is believed that the present volume
of “The Canterbury Poets” will supply a sensibly-felt want in modern
English poetic literature.</p>

<p>Winthrop Mackworth Praed was the third and youngest son of William
Mackworth Praed, serjeant-at-law, who was the first chairman of the
Audit Board, a post which he filled for many years.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_12">{12}</a></span> He was born on the
26th July 1802, at 35 John Street, Bedford Row, his father’s London
residence, although Bitton House, at Teignmouth, the country seat of the
family, was always regarded as his paternal home. The original surname
of the family was Mackworth, the additional name of Praed having been
assumed some generations earlier. Praed’s mother was a Miss Winthrop, a
member of a family descended from the same stock as the American
Winthrops. He had the misfortune to lose her while he was yet very
young, but her place was, so far as a mother’s place can be filled,
worthily taken by an elder sister, to whom he was all his life sincerely
attached, and who seems to have been the inspiring genius of his
earliest poetical efforts. Young Praed was always, it appears, a
constitutionally delicate lad, with a strong taste for studious
pursuits, and small inclination, comparatively, for the rougher
pleasures of a schoolboy,&#8212;although he was not altogether without mark
in the cricket-field and on the river. The fancy for verse-writing
developed itself in him at a very early age, and Mr. Derwent Coleridge
has preserved from oblivion several of his precocious efforts. There is
nothing particularly remarkable in these early verses, beyond those of
other juvenile poets, so far at least as the thought is concerned: the
best of them is, perhaps, a letter addressed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_13">{13}</a></span> his elder sister Susan,
“The Forget-me-not,” in which Praed’s fine sense of form is
conspicuously evidenced. This was, no doubt, to a great extent
instinctive, but his singularly finished style owed a great deal to his
father’s severe criticism, Serjeant Praed being a man of sound literary
taste, and a great stickler for form.</p>

<p>In 1814 young Winthrop went to Eton, where his poetical proclivities
were yet further encouraged by his tutor, Dr. Hawtrey. Two Eton
periodicals, <i>The College Magazine</i> and <i>Horæ Otiosæ</i>, were conducted by
some of the boys in the year 1819, and circulated in MS. It does not
appear that Praed contributed to either of these, but when they were
dropped in 1820, he brought out a MS. journal of his own, the <i>Apis
Matina</i>, of which six numbers were published in the months of April,
May, June, and July. About half the contents of these papers were
written by Praed himself, the other contributors being the Honourable
Francis Curzon and Walter Trower, afterwards Bishop of Gibraltar. About
this time Charles Knight printed at Windsor a selection of the poetry of
the <i>College Magazine</i>, and Praed and some other ambitious spirits set
on foot a project for a regularly published <i>College Magazine</i>. Knight
agreed to undertake the printing, subject to certain guarantees, which
were obtained, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_14">{14}</a></span> October 1820 appeared the first number of the
<i>Etonian</i>, perhaps the most remarkable schoolboy magazine ever produced.
Praed and Walter Blunt were joint editors, the bulk of the contents of
the <i>Magazine</i> being supplied by the former. His literary fecundity at
this time was, considering his age, remarkable. The contributions to the
Magazine were supposed to be supplied by the members of an association
called “The King of Clubs.” They were known by <i>noms de plume</i>, Praed’s
being that of Peregrine Courtenay, the President of the Club. There was
a prose introduction to each number, describing the proceedings of the
Club, the whole of which was in every case written by Praed. During the
ten months’ existence of the <i>Magazine</i> he also contributed to it the
following poems, all of some length:&#8212;“The Eve of Battle,” “Changing
Quarters,” “The County Ball,” “Gog,” “Surly Hall,” “Reminiscences of my
Youth,” “To Julia,” “To Julio,” “To Florence,” “The Bachelor,” “How to
Rhyme for Love,” etc., as well as several smaller poems. The staff of
the <i>Etonian</i> otherwise comprised a good array of names. Among them were
the Honourable William Ashley, Edmond Beales, William Chrichton,
Honourable Francis Curzon, R. Durnford, William Henry Ord, Thomas Powys
Outram, Walter Trower&#8212;all boys then at Eton. One Oxonian&#8212;Henry
Neech&#8212;con<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_15">{15}</a></span>tributed, and five Cantabs&#8212;Henry Nelson Coleridge, John
Moultrie, John Louis Petit, William Sydney Walker, and another. Among
the anonymous contributors were R. Streatfield and J. A. Kinglake.</p>

<p>The <i>Etonian</i> appeared regularly every month until July 1821, when it
was discontinued in consequence of the editor and principal contributor
going up to Cambridge. In Charles Knight’s “Passages of a Working Life”
there occur, about this date, many references to his first connection
with Praed and his friends in the conduct of the <i>Etonian</i>. He
says:&#8212;“The character of Peregrine Courtenay, given in an ‘Account of
the proceedings which led to the publication of the <i>Etonian</i>,’
furnishes no satisfactory idea of the youthful Winthrop Mackworth Praed,
when he is described as one ‘possessed of sound good sense rather than
of brilliancy of genius.’ His ‘general acquirements and universal
information’ are fitly recorded, as well as his acquaintance with ‘the
world at large.’ But the kindness that lurks under sarcasm; the wisdom
that wears the mask of fun; the half melancholy that is veiled by
levity&#8212;these qualities very soon struck me as far out of the ordinary
indications of precocious talent. It is not easy to separate my
recollections of the Praed of Eton from those of the Praed of Cambridge.
The Etonian of 1820 was natural and unaffected in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_16">{16}</a></span> talk, neither shy
nor presuming; proud, without a tinge of vanity; somewhat reserved, but
ever courteous; giving few indications of the susceptibility of the
poet, but ample evidence of the laughing satirist; a pale and slight
youth, who had looked upon the aspects of society with the keen
perception of a clever manhood; one who had, moreover, seen in human
life something more than follies to be ridiculed by the gay jest, or
scouted by the sarcastic sneer. His writings then, especially his poems,
occasionally exhibited that remarkable union of pathos with wit and
humour which attested the originality of his genius, as it was
subsequently displayed in maturer efforts.”</p>

<p>During Praed’s second year at Cambridge he wrote to Charles Knight (who
was then contemplating establishing himself in London), to the effect
that he should take up no periodical work until Knight started a
publication of his own. In consequence of this communication Knight
visited Cambridge in December 1822, where he spent a pleasant week with
Praed and his friends, making the acquaintance of Macaulay, Maiden, and
Derwent Coleridge, and there and then settled the general plan of
Knight’s <i>Quarterly Magazine</i>, the first number of which was shortly
afterwards brought out.</p>

<p>Praed wrote “Castle Vernon,” the introductory<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_17">{17}</a></span> portion of the new
<i>Magazine</i>, of which, for some numbers, he may be considered to have
been the guiding spirit, although the responsible editorship was vested
in Knight himself. The principal contributors were Winthrop Mackworth
Praed, who used two <i>noms de plume</i> (Peregrine Courtenay, and Vyvyan
Joyeuse), Thomas Babington Macaulay (Tristram Merton), John Moultrie
(Gerard Montgomery), Derwent Coleridge (Davenant Cecil), William Sidney
Walker (Edward Hazelfoot), Henry Maiden (Hamilton Murray), and Henry
Nelson Coleridge (Joseph Haller). Praed’s prose style is bright and
lively. The “Castle Vernon” papers show it at about its best, but their
interest generally is very local and ephemeral. There are some clever
little caricatures of some of the principal contributors sketched in
here and there, one of which, as an early portrait of Macaulay, it may
be worth while to reproduce:&#8212;</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Tristram Merton, come into court!’ There came up a short, manly
figure, marvellously upright, with a bad neckcloth, and one hand in his
waist-coat pocket. Of regular beauty he had little to boast; but in
faces where there is an expression of great power, or great good-humour,
or of both, you do not regret its absence.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>They were glorious days,’ he said, with a bend and a look of
chivalrous gallantry to the circle<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_18">{18}</a></span> around him, ‘they were glorious days
for old Athens when all she held of witty and of wise, of brave and of
beautiful, was collected in the drawing room of Aspasia. In those, the
brightest and noblest times of Greece, there was no feeling so strong as
the devotion of youth, no talisman of such virtue as the smile of
beauty. Aspasia was the arbitress of peace and war, the queen of arts
and arms, the Pallas of the spear and the pen; we have looked back to
those golden hours with transport and with longing. Here our classical
dreams shall in some sort wear a dress of reality. He who has not the
piety of a Socrates may at least fall down before as lovely a divinity;
he who has not the power of a Pericles may at least kneel before as
beautiful an Aspasia.’</p>

<p>“His tone had just so much of earnest, that what he said was felt as a
compliment, and just so much banter that it was felt to be nothing more.
As he concluded he dropped on one knee and paused.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Tristram,’ said the Attorney-General, ‘we really are sorry to cramp a
culprit in his line of defence; but the time of the court must not be
taken up. If you can speak ten words to the purpose’&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>Prythee, Frederic,’ retorted the other, ‘leave me to manage my own
course. I have an arduous journey to run; and, in such a circle, like
the poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_19">{19}</a></span> prince in the <i>Arabian Tales</i>, I must be frozen into stone
before I can finish my task without turning to the right or the left.’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>For the love you bear us, a truce to your similes: they shall be
felony without benefit of clergy; and silence for an hour shall be the
penalty.’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>A penalty for similes! horrible! Paul of Russia prohibited round hats,
Chihu of China denounced white teeth, but this is atrocious!’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I beseech you, Tristram, if you can for a moment forget your
omniscience, let us&#8212;&#8212;’</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I will endeavour. It is related of Zoroaster that&#8212;&#8212;’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p class="cdtts">. . . . . . . .</p>

<p>Knight’s <i>Quarterly</i> was started with much spirit, and promised to
become a great success. Much was hoped for from the co-operation of
Macaulay, but after the appearance of the first number he was compelled
to withdraw his name from the list of contributors, although with much
regret, in deference to the wishes of his family, whose religious
scruples, it is to be presumed, were alarmed at the frivolous character
of the publication. The difficulty was subsequently surmounted, and
Macaulay resumed his connection with the <i>Magazine</i> with the third
number. His contributions to it were noteworthy, and included his fine
poems of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_20">{20}</a></span> “Ivry” and “Moncontour,” and the “Songs of the Civil War.” In
the interval, Praed worked hard to fill the void caused by Macaulay’s
defection, and his contributions in prose and verse make up about
one-third of the contents of the second number of the <i>Magazine</i>. In
this number was published the first canto of his unfinished poem, “The
Troubadour.” With De Quincey and Barry St. Leger added to the staff of
the <i>Magazine</i>, its prospects appeared bright enough, but dissensions
arose among the contributors, which finally led to its being
discontinued. It is impossible to say now what were the exact grounds of
quarrel. It appears evident, however, that Knight was properly tenacious
of his position as responsible editor, and declined to admit the
irresponsible interference of his undergraduate staff. Praed seems to
have become jealous, and impatient of editorial supervision, and seceded
from the <i>Magazine</i>, carrying most of his friends with him. Knight’s
<i>Quarterly</i> ceased to appear, therefore, after the publication of the
sixth number. An attempt was subsequently made to carry it on with
another staff, but the character of the publication was materially
altered, and in its new form it failed to command popularity. Charles
Knight had published a rather bitter notice in No. 6 of the <i>Magazine</i>,
to which Praed replied in a letter addressed to the <i>Cambridge
Chronicle</i>. Knight<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_21">{21}</a></span> wrote a rejoinder, and there the matter ended. Two
months later, however, Praed called upon Knight of his own accord, and
friendly intercourse was resumed between them, so that in the Spring of
1826 we find Praed again co-operating with Knight and Barry St. Leger in
the conduct of a new periodical. This was <i>The Brazen Head</i>, a cheap
weekly publication, that was designed to deal with current events in a
humorous manner. The Friar Bacon legend was utilised as a framework, and
the Friar and the Head, under Praed’s direction, discoursed wittily
together, week by week, upon the topics of the day. “We had,” said
Knight, “four weeks of this pleasantry: and, what was not an advantage,
we had nearly all the amusement to ourselves, for the number of our
purchasers was not legion.” So <i>The Brazen Head</i> went the way of its
predecessor. Brief though its existence was, it contained some of
Winthrop Praed’s most charming and characteristic verse. The opening
poem of the first number, “The Chant of the Brazen Head,” is in
particular unsurpassable among his compositions.</p>

<p>Praed’s literary occupations were not permitted to interfere with his
University work to any serious extent, although they absorbed most of
his interest. The Rev. Derwent Coleridge says, with reference to his
University career, ‘There can be no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_22">{22}</a></span> that he might have attained
higher distinction as a scholar by a course of systematic study, for he
showed in after life both the power of thorough investigation and a
sense of its value; but the bent of his genius, and perhaps the state of
his bodily health, inclined him to a more discursive occupation. As it
was, though he failed as a competitor for the University scholarship,
the long and shining list of his academic honours bore full testimony,
not merely to his extraordinary talent, but to the high character of his
scholastic attainments.</p>

<p>“In 1822 he gained Sir William Browne’s medal for the Greek Ode, and for
the Epigrams; in 1823 the same medal a second time for the Greek Ode,
with the first prize for English and Latin declamation in his college.
In 1824, Sir William Browne’s medal a second time for Epigrams. In 1823
and 1824 he also gained the Chancellor’s medal for English
verse&#8212;‘Australasia’ being the subject the former year, and ‘Athens’ in
the latter. In the classical tripos his name appeared twice in the list,
a high position, yet scarcely adding to the reputation which he already
enjoyed. In 1827 he was successful in the examination for a Trinity
Fellowship, and in 1830 he completed his University triumphs by gaining
the Seatonian prize.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_23">{23}</a></span>”</p>

<p>On leaving Cambridge, Praed practised for a while at the bar, apparently
with no great success. Politics at this time engaged his attention more
particularly, and in 1830 he was returned to Parliament for the first
time, as member for the soon-to-be-extinguished borough of St. Germains.
Praed had been a rival of Macaulay’s for the leadership of the Union,
and much was expected of him as a speaker. Of course he disappointed
expectations, but his contributions to the debate on the Reform Bill of
1830, although not brilliant, were not ineffective. He was the mover of
two amendments: one that freeholds in boroughs should confer borough and
not county votes; and the other, in support of which his most successful
speech was delivered, was a scheme of minority representation, that
appears to have been identical with that which has been, until recently,
in force in three-cornered constituencies.</p>

<p>St. Germains having been disfranchised, Praed in 1832 unsuccessfully
contested St. Ives, in Cornwall, where he had some family influence.
Being excluded from Parliament, he turned his attention to political
journalism, and became a leader-writer on the <i>Morning Post</i>, to which
paper also he contributed numerous anonymous political squibs. Praed
began his career as a Liberal, but about this time he became a convert
to Conserva<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_24">{24}</a></span>tive opinions. Of this change of front he himself writes to
a friend: “My old college opinions have been considerably modified by
subsequent acquaintance with the world and observation of things <i>as
they are</i>. I am not going to stem a torrent, but I should like to
confine its fury within some bounds.... So my part in political matters
will probably expose me to all sorts of abuse for ratting, and so forth.
I abandon the party, if ever I belonged to it, in which my friends and
my interests are both to be found, and I adopt one where I can hope to
earn nothing but a barren reputation, and the consciousness of meaning
well.”</p>

<p>His connection with the <i>Morning Post</i> led to a personal acquaintance
with the leaders of the Tory party; and overtures having been made to
him in 1835 to join Sir Robert Peel’s Administration, he accepted the
post of Secretary to the Board of Control, and re-entered Parliament as
member for Great Yarmouth. In the same year he married Helen, daughter
of George Bogle, Esq.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel’s Government came to a sudden and untimely end in about
three months, and with it ended Praed’s brief career as a minister.</p>

<p>In 1837 he retired from Great Yarmouth, and was returned for Aylesbury,
which borough he continued to represent until his death, which occurred
in 1839. His health, never robust, is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_25">{25}</a></span> been permanently
affected by his exertions at the Great Yarmouth election of 1834, and to
this has been attributed the development of the fatal lung disease to
which he fell a victim. The winter of 1838-39 he spent at St. Leonard’s
with his wife and two infant daughters, returning to London for the
meeting of Parliament in February 1839, when his general health appeared
to have improved. His energy was untiring: he was constant in his
attendance during the seven nights’ debate on the Corn Laws, and in May,
when the House adjourned, consequent upon a change of Government, he
paid a flying visit to Cambridge in his official capacity of Deputy High
Steward of the University. The weather was very severe, and on his
returning to London his health was visibly breaking up. He continued to
attend in his place in the House of Commons, however, until the middle
of June, when he paired for the remainder of the Session with Lord
Arundel. On the 15th of July he was dead.</p>

<p>During the last ten or twelve years of his life Praed was a constant
contributor of verse to the periodicals of his day, although he was
never associated with any purely literary undertaking in the same
intimate manner as he was in the case of Knight’s <i>Quarterly Magazine</i>.
Charles Knight engaged his and John Moultrie’s co-operation in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_26">{26}</a></span>
<i>Friendship’s Offering</i> for 1827, which he, Knight, edited for Smith &amp;
Elder. Praed contributed the “Red Fisherman,” the only one of his
legendary ballads that has achieved any lasting popularity. Praed’s
original title for this poem was “The Devil’s Decoy,” which “some
blockhead in the confidence of the publishers” thought fit, on his own
responsibility, to alter to “The Red Fisherman.” Praed was very angry,
and was disposed to regard Charles Knight as responsible, and it was
with difficulty that another rupture between the old friends was
averted. “The Red Fisherman” has been frequently quoted, and it has been
the fashion to regard it as Praed’s happiest effort in ballad writing,
although in what respect it can be deemed superior to “The Bridal of
Belmont,” “The Haunted Tree,” “The Teufelhaus,”&#8212;which is even more
weirdly powerful&#8212;it is impossible to say. “The Troubadour,” Praed’s
longest poem, contains much that is very charming. The first two cantos
of it were published in Knight’s <i>Quarterly</i>. Praed’s secession from the
<i>Magazine</i> interrupted the continuation. Only a portion of the third
canto was ever written. The poem is very indeterminate in character, and
might have been carried on indefinitely, as each canto brings the hero
into a new field of adventure, and supplies a tale or episode complete
in itself. The poem, even as far as it was published, is too<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_27">{27}</a></span> lengthy
for insertion <i>in extenso</i>, but selected lyrics from it will be found in
this volume.</p>

<p>Praed’s claim to distinction, however, rests entirely upon his Poetry of
Life and Manners. As a writer of what, for want of a better name, we
call <i>Vers de Société</i>, he was in his time unapproachable, and has
hardly, at any time, been surpassed. Verse-writing of this class in
Praed’s early days had sunk to a very low ebb. Neither Canning’s wit nor
Moore’s gay fancy inspired the vapid scribblers who filled albums and
keepsakes with “Lines to Ladies’ Portraits,”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Soft songs to Julia’s cockatoo,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Fierce odes to Famine and to Slaughter.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Praed taught his contemporaries to be natural. He had a remarkable
fluency of expression. He was humorous, witty, and good-natured; he was
a man of the world, and knew his world well, gauged its weaknesses with
accuracy, and judged them with the leniency of a good-humoured worldly
philosopher, contriving, meanwhile, not to forfeit his own character for
honesty and healthiness of mind. There is nothing very deep about
Praed’s poetry, yet is it not entirely superficial. He had keen insight
and plenty of discrimination, but for great passion or sustained power
he had no capabilities. Lightly and gracefully he skated over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_28">{28}</a></span> thin
surface ice of sentiment, not ignorant of, yet with little desire to
fathom, the unknown depths of passion and suffering that lay beneath.
“The genius of gentleman” claimed for Horace by the late Lord Lytton,
belonged to Praed in no common degree. No man equally witty and
brilliant was ever more perfectly well-bred in his writings: without
prudery, affectation, or cant, he was never slangy, suggestive, or
irreverent: he even achieved the difficult art of writing political
satires that lost none of their point from the fact of their being free
from coarseness or personality. He was a typical society poet,
compounded of wit, scholar, and gentleman. His world was not a very
serious or a very earnest world, and he wrote of it pretty much as he
found it, with some slight touches of half-sad, half-cynical, but never
unkindly moralising; yet with all its faults it was a pleasant world to
those whom it treated well, and a man laden with society’s favours, as
was Praed, was not likely to develop into a Democritus. Few poets have
been better treated by the world than he was: the paths of literature
and politics were never thorny ones to him; his talents brought him
reputation before he had ever struggled to attain it. Helping hands were
freely held out to him from the hour of his first schoolboy success; he
was popular in society, fortunate in friendship, and, above all things,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_29">{29}</a></span>
happy in his family and domestic affections. Mr. Locker remarks of the
qualities of his poetry, that “his fancy is less wild than Moore’s,
while his sympathies are narrower than Thackeray’s.” Both statements
(qualified by the further expression of opinion that has already been
quoted) may be accepted without much demur. With regard to the latter
remark, there are indeed few writers of the century of whom it might
not, with equal justice, have been made. Admitting that his sympathies
were neither very deep nor very wide, they are at least essentially and
uniformly healthy and pure. Whatever might have been Praed’s matter, his
manner, although not versatile, is always good. His fluency of
expression is remarkable, and must have even been a source of weakness,
since a man who wrote so much, so constantly, and with so little effort,
must almost inevitably have perpetrated a good deal of inferior work in
his time. What Praed published formed only a portion of what he wrote,
for he was always ready to scribble verse on slight temptation; and that
“inquisitive man with the note book,” Nathaniel Parker Willis, who met
Praed at a country house, has left it on record that he was ever open to
furnish contributions to the inevitable album that every fair one
cherished in those days. Praed’s style, as has been said, is not
versatile:<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_30">{30}</a></span> he never hazarded possible harshness by metrical
experiments, and the measures that he particularly affected have become
intimately associated with the general characteristics of his style; his
rhyme and rhythm are both perfect, and apparently instinctive, as if
writing in metre were as effortless an exercise to him as writing in
prose.</p>

<p>To conclude in the words of the Rev. Derwent Coleridge, “Not unknown,
nor without mark in the arena of political conflict, the name of Praed
is still remembered as at least that of a forward pupil in the school of
statesmanship; and though his literary honours, won in earliest manhood,
and sustained by the casual productions of a leisure hour, were worn
carelessly, while he was preparing for more serious duties, yet now that
years have gone by, and we have to audit the past with no expectation of
any future account, we find that he has left behind him a permanent
expression of wit and grace, refined and tender feeling, of inventive
fancy and acute observation, unique in character, and his own by an
undisputed title.”</p>

<span class="i0">The Abbot arose, and closed his book,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And donned his sandal shoon,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wandered forth, alone, to look<br></span>
<span class="i2">Upon the summer moon:<br></span>
<span class="i0">A starlight sky was o’er his head,<br></span>
<span class="i2">A quiet breeze around;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the flowers a thrilling fragrance shed,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And the waves a soothing sound:<br></span>
<span class="i0">It was not an hour, nor a scene, for aught<br></span>
<span class="i2">But love and calm delight;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the holy man had a cloud of thought<br></span>
<span class="i2">On his wrinkled brow that night.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gazed on the river that gurgled by,<br></span>
<span class="i2">But he thought not of the reeds;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_32">{32}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">He clasped his gilded rosary,<br></span>
<span class="i2">But he did not tell the beads;<br></span>
<span class="i0">If he looked to the heaven, ’twas not to invoke<br></span>
<span class="i2">The Spirit that dwelleth there;<br></span>
<span class="i0">If he opened his lips, the words they spoke<br></span>
<span class="i2">Had never the tone of prayer.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A pious priest might the Abbot seem,<br></span>
<span class="i2">He had swayed the crozier well;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But what was the theme of the Abbot’s dream,<br></span>
<span class="i2">The Abbot were loth to tell.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Companionless, for a mile or more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He traced the windings of the shore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, beauteous is that river still,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As it winds by many a sloping hill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And many a dim o’erarching grove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And many a flat and sunny cove,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And terraced lawns, whose bright arcades<br></span>
<span class="i0">The honeysuckle sweetly shades,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And rocks, whose very crags seem bowers,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So gay they are with grass and flowers!<br></span>
<span class="i0">But the Abbot was thinking of scenery<br></span>
<span class="i2">About as much, in sooth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As a lover thinks of constancy,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Or an advocate of truth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He did not mark how the skies in wrath<br></span>
<span class="i2">Grew dark above his head;<br></span>
<span class="i0">He did not mark how the mossy path<br></span>
<span class="i2">Grew damp beneath his tread;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And nearer he came, and still more near,<br></span>
<span class="i2">To a pool, in whose recess<br></span>
<span class="i0">The water had slept for many a year,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Unchanged and motionless;<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the river stream it spread away<br></span>
<span class="i2">The space of half a rood;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_33">{33}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The surface had the hue of clay<br></span>
<span class="i2">And the scent of human blood;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The trees and the herbs that round it grew<br></span>
<span class="i2">Were venomous and foul,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the birds that through the bushes flew<br></span>
<span class="i2">Were the vulture and the owl;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The water was as dark and rank<br></span>
<span class="i2">As ever a company pumped,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the perch, that was netted and laid on the bank,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Grew rotten while it jumped;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bold was the man who thither came<br></span>
<span class="i2">At midnight, man or boy,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For the place was cursed with an evil name,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And that name was “The Devil’s Decoy!”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Abbot was weary as abbot could be,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he sat down to rest on the stump of a tree:<br></span>
<span class="i0">When suddenly rose a dismal tone&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was it a song, or was it a moan?<br></span>
<span class="i10">“O ho! O ho!<br></span>
<span class="i10">Above&#8212;below&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lightly and brightly they glide and go!<br></span>
<span class="i0">The hungry and keen on the top are leaping,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The lazy and fat in the depths are sleeping;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fishing is fine when the pool is muddy,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Broiling is rich when the coals are ruddy.”<br></span>
<span class="i0">In a monstrous fright, by the murky light,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He looked to the left and he looked to the right,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And what was the vision close before him,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That flung such a sudden stupor o’er him?<br></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas a sight to make the hair uprise,<br></span>
<span class="i4">And the life blood colder run:<br></span>
<span class="i0">The startled priest struck both his thighs,<br></span>
<span class="i4">And the abbey clock struck one!<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_34">{34}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All alone, by the side of the pool,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A tall man sat on a three-legged stool,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Kicking his heels on the dewy sod,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And putting in order his reel and rod;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Red were the rags his shoulders wore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a high red cap on his head he bore;<br></span>
<span class="i0">His arms and his legs were long and bare;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And two or three locks of long red hair<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were tossing about his scraggy neck,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like a tattered flag o’er a splitting wreck.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It might be time, or it might be trouble,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had bent that stout back nearly double,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sunk in their deep and hollow sockets<br></span>
<span class="i0">That blazing couple of Congreve rockets,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And shrunk and shrivelled that tawny skin,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till it hardly covered the bones within.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The line the Abbot saw him throw<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had been fashioned and formed long ages ago,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the hands that worked his foreign vest<br></span>
<span class="i0">Long ages ago had gone to their rest:<br></span>
<span class="i0">You would have sworn, as you looked on them,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He had fished in the flood with Ham and Shem!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was turning of keys, and creaking of locks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As he took forth a bait from his iron box.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Minnow or gentle, worm or fly&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed not such to the Abbot’s eye;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gaily it glittered with jewel and gem,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And its shape was the shape of a diadem.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It was fastened a gleaming hook about<br></span>
<span class="i0">By a chain within and a chain without;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fisherman gave it a kick and a spin,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the water fizzed as it tumbled in!<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_35">{35}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From the bowels of the earth<br></span>
<span class="i0">Strange and varied sounds had birth;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now the battle’s bursting peal,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Neigh of steed, and clang of steel;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now an old man’s hollow groan<br></span>
<span class="i0">Echoed from the dungeon stone;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now the weak and wailing cry<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of a stripling’s agony!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Cold by this was the midnight air;<br></span>
<span class="i2">But the Abbot’s blood ran colder,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When he saw a gasping knight lie there,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With a gash beneath his clotted hair,<br></span>
<span class="i2">And a hump upon his shoulder.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the loyal churchman strove in vain<br></span>
<span class="i2">To mutter a Pater Noster;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he who writhed in mortal pain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was camped that night on Bosworth plain&#8212;<br></span>
<span class="i2">The cruel Duke of Glo’ster!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was turning of keys and creaking of locks,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As he took forth a bait from his iron box.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It was a haunch of princely size,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Filling with fragrance earth and skies.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The corpulent Abbot knew full well<br></span>
<span class="i0">The swelling form, and the steaming smell;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Never a monk that wore a hood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could better have guessed the very wood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where the noble hart had stood at bay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Weary and wounded, at close of day.<br></span>

<span class="i0">Rated servant, greeted guest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_36">{36}</a></span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Grace, I ween, was never said!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pulling and tugging the Fisherman sat;<br></span>
<span class="i4">And the Priest was ready to vomit,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When he hauled out a gentleman, fine and fat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With a belly as big as a brimming vat,<br></span>
<span class="i4">And a nose as red as a comet.<br></span>
<span class="i0">“A capital stew,” the Fisherman said,<br></span>
<span class="i4">“With cinnamon and sherry!”<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the Abbot turned away his head,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For his brother was lying before him dead&#8212;<br></span>

<span class="i0">There was turning of keys, and creaking of locks,<br></span>

<span class="i0">A peacock’s tail, and a butterfly’s wings,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A scarlet slipper, an auburn curl,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A mantle of silk, and a bracelet of pearl,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a packet of letters, from whose sweet fold<br></span>
<span class="i0">Such a stream of delicate odours rolled,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That the Abbot fell on his face, and fainted,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And deemed his spirit was half-way sainted.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sounds seemed dropping from the skies,<br></span>

<span class="i0">As he came at last to a bishop’s mitre!<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_38">{38}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">From top to toe the Abbot shook,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As the Fisherman armed his golden hook,<br></span>

<span class="i0">By some dark dream or wakened thought.<br></span>

<span class="i0">The way was lone, and the hour was late,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Sir Rudolph was far from his castle gate.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The night came down by slow degrees<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the river stream, and the forest trees;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And by the heat of the heavy air,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Then, as I see some village maid<br></span>

<span class="i0">For breaking hearts as well as strings:<br></span>
<span class="i0">In short, I’m very sure that all<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who seek or sigh for Beauty’s thrall<br></span>
<span class="i0">May breathe their vows, and feed their passion,<br></span>

<p class="c">PROSPECTUS.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> main idea in instituting this Edition is to provide the general
reader with a comprehensive Prose Library after his own heart,&#8212;an
Edition, that is to say, cheap, without the reproach which cheapness
usually implies, comprising volumes of shapely form, well printed, well
bound, and thoroughly representative of the leading prose writers of all
time. Placed thus upon a popular basis, making the principle of literary
selection a broadly human rather than an academic one, the Edition will,
the Publisher hopes, contest not ineffectually the critical suffrages of
the democratic shilling.</p>

<p>As in the <span class="smcap">Canterbury Poets</span> issued from the same press, to which this
aims at being a companion series, the <i>Editing</i> of the volumes will be a
special feature. This will be entrusted to writers who will each, in
freshly treated, suggestive Introductions, give just that account of the
book and its author which will enable the significance of both in life
and literature, and their relation to modern thought, to be readily
grasped. And where, for the successful rescue of old-time books for
modern reading, revision and selection are necessary, the editing will
be done with careful zeal and with reverence always for the true spirit
of the book. In the first volume a General Introduction by the Editor
will appear, explaining more fully the bearing of the series, which, in
course of time, it is hoped, will form</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
